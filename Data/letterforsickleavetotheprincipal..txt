Subject: Request for Sick Leave

Dear [Principal's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number] days, from [start date] to [end date], as I am currently unwell and unable to attend school. I am suffering from [mention your illness, e.g., fever, cold, etc.] and my doctor has advised me to take rest for a few days.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that I will catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. I will make sure to complete all my pending assignments and submit them to my teachers on my return.

Please grant me leave for the mentioned period, and I would be grateful if you could approve my request.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
